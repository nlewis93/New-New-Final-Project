# cs0134_project
Class project for cs0134

Transitioning from the first portion of the class project I decided to adapt my site to be more functional and complete. I added all of the proper 6 HTML files for 
specific watches that "Alpha" sells. Also I added two pages that offer users to become members (and why they should). I also added a place for the users to login 
or register their emails to become members. This is where I would have liked to add more to the site. Adding a backend database to store these user accounts would 
be very usual to learn. Also, I would like to implement js to strategically place certain data into one html based on the watch they have selected instead of having
6 different html files all on their own.
